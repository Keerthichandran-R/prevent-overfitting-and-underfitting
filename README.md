# Student Performance Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline to predict **student performance scores** based on synthetic data.  
The model is trained and evaluated using **Linear Regression** and the results are visualized.

---

## Features
- Generates synthetic student data (study hours, sleep hours, attendance, etc.).
- Trains a **Linear Regression model** to predict scores.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.
- Visualizes training and testing performance.
- Saves results into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Files
- `student_performance.py` → Main script to run the project.  
- `student_performance.csv` → Generated dataset of student performance.  
- `README.md` → Documentation for the project.

## Requirements
Install dependencies before running the code:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
